A simple **PyQt** desktop application for using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo: it consists of working in 25 minutes intervals, separated by short breaks (usually 5 minutes) and a long break (15-30 minutes) after 4 consecutive cycles.

I've used PyQt version 5.15.4.
